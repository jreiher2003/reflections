What happens when you initialize a repository? Why 
do you need to do it?

it adds a hidden .git file to the directory.  I figure
it is so you can use Git version control on your local
machine.

How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you think 
it offers?	

the staging area helps you gather up all the things you
would like to commit to the respository.  then you can 
add them all at once if it makes sence to do so.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have 
one commit per logical change?

git diff --staged will see the diff in your code before you
commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in 
keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches will help in implementing new features while maintaining
a production copy that can be used in the meantime.  

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
it helps you see where you are at, what state you are in and
then how to save logical changes back to the master.  

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we 
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is one master but with all the saved commits from master
and the branch that merged into it.
