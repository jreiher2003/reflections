How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file 
help you see the bug that was introduced?

With thousands of lines of code to consider with
larger projects comparing a new version of code with 
an old version can significantly cut down on your 
time searching for typos and errors quickly and 
efficiently.Great way to debug simple things that can 
be time consuming.

How could having easy access to the entire history of
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the 
long term?

you are able to see how long it takes for sections of 
code to grow. look at other coders commits for 
inspiration.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google 
docs does?

pros- you create logical backup points
cons- you might forget to save your work or there could
be a computer failure that would cause you to lose your 
work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is for software, and for software to work properly
there are dependencies which need to be tracked.  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to 
view the history of files?

to see the progress in action. also for debugging. 

How might using version control make you more confident 
to make changes that could break something? 

Knowing that you can alway revert to an older version at
any point is helpful with experimenting with new code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want 
to try using Git for?

I want to use git for all my projects.
