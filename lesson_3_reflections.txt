When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

when working with other repositories that are online or 
having other programmers work on yours that would also 
be online. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

other people may have made some commits in the meantime.  

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

forks are on github website, for when you don't have permission
to make changes.  clones are the same as remotes, use directly
or to make changes locally.  branches are for when you want 
to make changes on your own code or make different versions
of software you are developing.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known 
state of the remote stored locally?

for differences and for reachability for merging or fast-forwarding

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What 
would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could collab with dropbox and a shared folder, but updating 
changes would get messy.  

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch 
rather than directly in master? What benefits does each 
approach have?

When the changes or the feature you are working on takes more
than a day to finish.  with a branch you can be a little bit more
exploratory.  You would want to make wild changes to a master that is
already up and running.  So to try things out.
