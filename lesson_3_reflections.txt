When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

when working with other repositories that are online or 
having other programmers work on yours that would also 
be online. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

other people may have made some commits in the meantime.
