When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

when working with other repositories that are online or 
having other programmers work on yours that would also 
be online. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

other people may have made some commits in the meantime.  

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

forks are on github website, for when you don't have permission
to make changes.  clones are the same as remotes, use directly
or to make changes locally.  branches are for when you want 
to make changes on your own code or make different versions
of software you are developing.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known 
state of the remote stored locally?

for differences and for reachability for merging or fast-forwarding
